# Postman Guide
- You can try leetcode-parse APIs by using any http client, here we use [postman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support) as example.
We have prepared two postman configuration files, you can download them from [json files](../postman).<br><br>For sake of usage, you need to import two files into postman firstly.<br><br>
![import ](../../img/import_postman_conf.png)<br><br>
And change the initial environment `BASE_PATH` value to `<your local IP address>:8080`.<br><br>
![update env](../../img/revise_postman_env.png)<br><br>
-  You can try the api `Basic -> Get griffin version`, to make sure leetcode-parse service has started up.<br><br>
![update env](../../img/get_version.png)<br><br>
